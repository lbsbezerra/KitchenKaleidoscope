# Kitchen Kaleidoscope: A Recipe Exploration Journey!

**Kitchen Kaleidoscope** is a web application designed to support your culinary curiosity with a vast collection of recipes. This project serves as my final project for the WDD 330 course at BYU-Idaho, where I tried to use both the knowledge acquired throughout the course, and also my experience with frontend and backend technologies, whie trying to create a seamless user experience.

**Unveiling Culinary Delights:**

* It is using a clean and simple user interface.

* Allows user to search for their favourite recipe with the Spoonacular API.

* Provide user with random recipes in it's "Discover" page.

* In smaller screens such as of mobiles the cards on the Home page and the recipe cards are used via "Swipe mode" (trying to make it more responsive for them).
